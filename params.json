Please, however, keep in mind that due to the nature of these tests, some tests can fail depending on how the execution date relates to the number of days/months/years used to _calculate_ an estimated date.\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\nIf you want to improve this library, we do accept pull requests. Please do specify what deficiency your changes are meant to address and add unit tests to go with your changes.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n+ Mahram Z. Foadi, Just10 Inc.\r\n+ Atanas Roussev, Just10 Inc.",
